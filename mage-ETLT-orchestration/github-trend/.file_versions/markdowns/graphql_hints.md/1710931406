Batch query (i.e. typing the multiple queries of the same data format within a query) saves the cost of rate limit consumption. Example query is shown below, as well

Use something like below to calculate the rate limit consumption for batch query:
```python
query BatchQuery {
  Repository1: repository(owner: "freeCodeCamp", name: "freeCodeCamp") {
    name
    primaryLanguage {
      name
    }
  }
  Repository2: repository(owner: "EbookFoundation", name: "free-programming-books") {
    name
    primaryLanguage {
      name
    }
  }
  # Add more repositories as needed
  
  rateLimit {
    cost
    remaining
    resetAt
  }
}
```
